<title>Praise the Sun…</title>
 </head>
 <body>
  <p>Let me not forget at least,
	after the three day rain,
	beaks raised face, the two starlings
	at and near the top twig</p>
 <p>of the white-oak, dwarfing
	the barn, completing the minute
	green of the sculptured foliage, their
	bullet heads bent back, their horny </p>
 <p>lips chattering to the morning 
	sun! Praise! While the 
	wraithlike warblers, all but unseen
	in looping flight dart from </p>
<p> pine to spruce, spruce to pine
	southward. Southward! where
	new mating warms the wit and cold
	does not strike, for respite. </p>
