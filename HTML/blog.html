                <p>July 24 2023. Sunday at Capitol Hill Block Party. A festival set up on the streets of cap hill. This year we saw five artists. i///u was first, a jazz band made up of talented young musicians. They were well rehearsed, and performed original songs in matching jumpsuits. Their group included a saxophone, a flute, a guitarist and bassist, drummer, a keyboard, two vocalists, and one guy shredding some sort of synthesizer oboe thing. Next we saw a young pop act named Zia Victoria. Sweet songs with a tinge of teenage angst a l√° Olivia Rodrigo. Surf Mesa, an energetic DJ given a viral boost from tiktok, performed house mashups on the mainstage. During his set, we ducked into Neumos. In the small, dark, theatre a rock trio called Weep Wave blasted their Idles-esque guitar rock over reverb drenched vocals. Songs quickly four-counted into the next, which gave a seamless feeling to their performance. The lead singer played a red SG, and would open his eyes wide and shout into the mic. One of our favorite performances from the day. Finally we saw rapper Mavi perform a passionate set on the Vera stage. His raps are dense and unique. I feel him as a more melodic Earl Sweatshirt, with beats that bounce a little more. He was a connected performer who loved to get the crowd involved. At the end of his set he waded into the crowd and asked us to "gimme a hug, Seattle".</p>

                <p>june 26th 2023. Notice John Wesley Powell's map of the "arid region of the united states" organized by drainage districts. Looking forward to finding a copy of his 1878 report. I'm reading his biography by Wallace Stegner, and it's fantastic so far. </p>
