        <grid-item><p>Spent holy weekend in Mar del Plata, abbreviated MDQ. The ocean was very nice. In Parque San Martin we enjoyed mate and medialunas. It's a shame I didn't see La Perla. This was a missed opportunity to encounter a work of Clorindo Testa.<p><p>On Saturday I experienced a strange coincidence. While sitting on the sand, I recognized somebody walking along the beach. It was a fellow who works out at the Plaza Rep√∫blica Oriental de Uruguay. There was no doubt, I recognized him from his checkered vans, blond hair and orange water bottle. He walked by, and I thought it was crazy that I had traveled 500k from Buenos Aires and encountered a familiar face.</p></grid-item>
