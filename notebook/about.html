        <p>Hi, welcome to my notebook. The <span style="color: var(--bluetooth);">www</span> is great but lately I've been trying to be on that real life algo more. It's nice to try to follow the links irl.</p>

        <p>In the past I've made several websites, some of which I still update.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://elliott.computer">elliott.computer</a> - I call this my computer website. </li>
            <li><a href="https://special.fish">special.fish</a> – <i>I made this website in 2018. I recently met someone that found love on sf. They met because their profiles were next to each other in the database. It was really nice to hear.</i></li>
            <li><a href="http://quiet.coffee">quiet.coffee</a> - I have yet to find a use for the domain name. It started as a life log, email experiment, new social media platform??</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
