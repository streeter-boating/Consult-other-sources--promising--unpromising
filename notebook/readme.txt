Thank you for purchasing this HTML template.

Templates give you a birdâ€™s-eye view of how websites are built. You can use these templates just as they are, or customize them to your liking so you can become more comfortable working with HTML and CSS.

Remember a website is just a collection of files and folders. Making connections (hyperlinks) between these files, turns them into a website.


IN THE BOX 
----------
+ index.html => the home page of your website
+ /entries => where all the notebook entry pages live
+ /recipes => another directory of recipe entries
+ /css => all the CSS (cascading style sheets). think of it like the paint + decoration.
+ /images => store all your images here. don't forget to resize them so they load quickly for your visitors.
+ about.html => about page
+ contact.html => contact page
+ readme.txt => this very page!
